# TwitterApi

The purpose of this application is to categorize the negative and the positives tweets concerning the two biggest political parties
in Greece and also the prime minister. This categorization was based on two dictionaries, the dictionary of the positive words and
the dictionary of the negative ones. Also we perform a Latent Semantic Index to create new dictionaries from the tweets.
